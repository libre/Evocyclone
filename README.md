==Resistancecovid==, we are a group of IT enthusiasts from various parts of Europe. We are actively working on the implementation of 3D printing protocols to meet the present and future needs of the nursing staff in front of the Covid-19.

EvoCyclone version 1.0. Artificial respirator allowing 10 to 30 cycles per minute. The first problem in all of the projects is the containment situation. It is complicated to reproduce the current GPL projects.

This is why, we based ourselves on an apparatus to realize starting from materials at disposal. Here, pinion and chain of bicycle, motor of windscreen wiper of car and the unit supplying in 12V.
 This development allows the addition of cardiac sensor, pressure sensor and other precision devices.

What it does and how we built it
The principle is based on a simple and robust device with as principle an elution from minimum materials. EvoCyclo is currently composed of:

2 x bicycle sprocket
4 x roller skates
1 x bicycle chain
2 x wooden plate.
1 profile L of shipyard site.
1 Front wiper motor 12v (VW polo small) for example (max 4A)
A Stepper module: https://www.amazon.com/Comimark-VNH2SP30-Stepper-Monster-Replace/dp/B07V3KR6N6
1 x arduino UNO (basic part for piloting EvoCyclone.
1 x OrangePIZero + (GPIO ARM 1Ghz) (clamp to 700Mhz) 512Mbram.
1 x Arduino MEGA (sensor part)
2 IR sensors https://www.amazon.fr/Rokoo-capteur-d%C3%A9vitement-dobstacles-infrarouge/dp/B0768KL78F (In progress)
1 ultrasonic sensor (presence of the balloon). https://www.amazon.fr/HC-SR04-capteur-distance-ultrasons-Arduino/dp/B00KKKT7YK
Challenges we ran into
Allow the development in Kit so as to allow certain to work different aspects of the projects. The idea being to use the principle of jumper in order to activate or not the functionalities.

Enabling the implementation of a complete system with security systems allowing it to be produced with components that can be easily found even in the most remote areas.
